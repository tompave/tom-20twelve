#tom-20twelve
This is a WordPress theme based on WordPress.org's **TwentyTwelve** theme.  

##How To
Since this is a [child theme](http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes), in order to use it you will need to have the parent theme ([TwentyTwelve](http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/twentytwelve)) in your server as well: 
  
    wordpress_root/
    └── wp-content/
    	└── themes/
    		├── twentytwelve/
    		└── tom-20twelve/

Please notice that this theme has been designed to use a 960px wide header. The ideal size is 960x256. If you plan to use an image with a different height, you might want to adjust the position of `h1.site-title`.  

##Demo
