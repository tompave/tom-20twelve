#tom-20twelve
This is a WordPress theme based on WordPress.org's **TwentyTwelve** theme.  

##How To
This is a [child theme](http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes), so you should need to have the parent theme (TwentyTwelve) in the parent folder:  
  
    wordpress_root/
    └── wp-conent/
    	└── themes/
    		├── twentytwelve/
    		└── tom-20twelve/

Also, this theme has been designed to use a 960px wide header.  
Ideally, it should be 960x256. If you want to use one with a different height, you might also want to change the position of `h1.site-title`.
